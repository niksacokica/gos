# gOS
A Garry's Mod addon that allows you to bring the power of a small and compact operating system inside the game.

<sup><sub>Yes, you could technically play Garry's Mod from inside itself since it does have a working internet browser.</sub></sup>

# Info
This addon will receive moderate support for the next several months (this timeframe might be moved to the end of 2024, but I will see). I will likely not add any requests in (unless they make it easier for developers to create content). The reason for this is that I am trying to leave Garry's Mod behind me. It's been fun to play this game and make content for it, but it's time for me to move on.

All issues are to be reported [here.](https://github.com/niksacokica/gos/issues) Issues reported anywhere else will be ignored!<br>
You can also ask for support in the [swrp devs discord.](https://swrp.dev/)

This project contains a [wiki(WIP).]() It is made for both users and developers.
